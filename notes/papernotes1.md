## 2.方法概括
### 目标
In this paper, our goal is to develop an end-to-end fault diagnosis system based on CNNs, which is motivated by its excellent feature learning ability. The desirable system can automatically learn and discover discriminative features from raw temporal vibration signals and then classify different health conditions of the WT gearbox.

### 背景理论与方法
convolutional neural networks

### ==方法要点==

### ==核心创新点==
The key idea of the proposed MSCNN is to incorporate multiscale feature learning ability into the traditional CNN architecture.
